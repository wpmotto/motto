[La console de recherche Google](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) vous permet de connecter votre site WordPress et de l'analyser en permanence pour les améliorations que Google souhaiterait voir.

C'est une mine d'informations car on peut supposer que suivre les propres recommandations de Google conduirait à un meilleur classement et à un meilleur trafic.

Nous connectons votre compte et vérifions votre console tous les mois pour nous assurer que vous disposez du site WordPress le plus convivial pour Google. Les recommandations sont fixées sur place – très simples, et pourtant très efficaces.

## Site Verification

We will verify you're WordPress site with Google Search Console so they can be connected and continuously scan your site for recommendations or issues.

## Index Coverage

If your site isn't being indexed by Google, you have no chance of ranking. This isn't usually a problem for your homepage, but if you have a large site, you may have many pages that aren't being indexed or that are causing issues in Google's index.

We check your [coverage report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7440203) every month and fix any issues your WordPress site may be having.

## Mobile Usability

[Over 50% of website traffic](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices) is on a mobile device. So if your site isn't optimized for mobile devices, you're likely losing interest from over half your audience due to poor usability.

If you've taken care to make your website responsive, that is indeed the best strategy! However, not every responsive site UI makes the cut. There are certain UI and functional patterns that should be adhered to in order to have a properly mobile optimized website.

Fortunately, Google Search Console will let you know [exactly what they are](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9063469) and we'll go ahead and fix them for you.
