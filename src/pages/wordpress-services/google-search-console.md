Google has a "search console" you can connect to that will tell you exactly what it wants to see from your website – no guesswork.

[Google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) allows you to connect your WordPress site and continuously analyze it for improvements Google would like to see.

This is a goldmine of information since one can assume that taking Google’s own recommendations would lead to better rankings and traffic.

We connect your account and check your console every month to ensure you have the most Google friendly WordPress site. Recommendations are fixed on the spot – very simple, and yet very effective.
