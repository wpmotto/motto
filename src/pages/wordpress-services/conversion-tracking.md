Having a website is an absolute necessity in this digital era and if you've gotten that far for your business already, congratulations! However, the next question you need to ask yourself is: **Is my website actually achieving its goals?**

This is the mistake we see many customers make when building a new site with us. They know they should have one, but they don't focus on __why they should have one__. This is partly our job and we always guide them into thinking about their website in a goal oriented way. We ask questions like:

- What to you want your visitor to know about you __immediately__ upon arriving to your homepage?
- What is your customer profile and demographic and how can we use this information to give them the best experience possible? How can we identify your customer over a random visitor to your website?
- What is the primary thing you want your customer to do with your website? What is the specific action? Call you? Email you? Buy something?
- How can we appropriately lead your ideal customer to this primary action? What does the ideal journey look like?
- If your customer doesn't take the primary action, how should we recapture their interest?

These are all good things to think about and relate to your web design and online marketing strategies. However, they're almost useless if you can't actually **measure** and **track their effectiveness**. This is why **conversion tracking** should be your very next step in building a website that works for your business. 

## What is Conversion Tracking?

Conversion tracking is the process of identifying certain actions and behaviours in your website, through user tracking software and determining the rate at which they fulfill your desired actions. By first determining your conversion rate, you can then measure the effectiveness of any changes you make to your website. This both saves you money, by not wasting time and money on things that don't actually work, and makes you money by fine-tuning the process and rate at which your website visitors become your customers. 

### Conversion Rate Formula

The formula for calculating your conversion rate is:

```
number of visitors that perform your desired action
---------------------------------------------------
            number of total visitors
```

## Conversion Tracking Installation

We can't determine a rate if we don't first track your user's actions. We will install and configure Google Analytics on your WordPress website and ensure it's working well. 

## Identify the Actions that Matter

We will help you identify the actions and behaviours that matter. It can be as simple as knowing when someone submitted your contact form, or more complicated like visitors coming from an email campaign that stay on your site for at least 1 minute, or visitors that go through a particular journey of pages before contacting you. 

## Professional Configuration of Google Analytics

Based on your input, we then configure Google Analytics to track the desired behaviour. This may include adding extra code to your website in order to properly track your desired actions. 

## Monthly Reports of Conversions and Business Critical Analytics

We then set up a report (separate from your website updates) that presents the most important information about the conversion metrics of your website so that you can properly make informed decisions. 

It can be quite complicated to simply look at the raw data in Google Analytics and come out with any meaningful conclusions. That's why we extract and distill the most important information for you in an easy to understand monthly report. 

We encourage you to call us if anything is unclear or you're not sure how to interpret something. At any point, you may also request a change in the metrics you're looking at and we'll update the report accordingly. 

## Universal to GA4 Migration

If you're not already aware, [Google's **universal analytics** will be going away](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en) and so by July 1st, 2023, if you're using Google Analytics, you must be using their newer GA4 integration. This means you also won't have access to the data you've collected with it forever. 

If this is the case for you, we will reinstall GA4, make a backup of the specific view you would like to retain and create a report outside of Google Analytics that you can access in case you would like to look at your historical data.
