# WordPress Hosting

One of the reasons WordPress is so popular is that it’s easily hosted. If you have PHP, MySQL and a web server, you’re up and running.

The problem is once your site starts to get some real traffic it can start to come to a crawl. With the traffic comes exposure, to regular visitors and hackers. Now at a critical time in your site’s evolution where you need it performing at its best, it’s at its worst.

This is where the difference between cheap shared web hosting and a dedicated WordPress hosting solution come in.
