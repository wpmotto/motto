## Why You Should Have a Professional Update WordPress

[Many studies show](https://sucuri.net/reports/19-sucuri-2018-hacked-report.pdf) that most hacked WordPress sites were compromised from out of date core or plugin files. This is almost entirely avoidable by keeping things up-to-date. This includes **plugins**, **themes**, **WordPress core**, and **server infrastructure**, and **PHP version**.

The problem is that this can sometimes be tricky because updates can break a website. They should be made on a staging environment and tested thoroughly before being done on your live site. We make this dead simple by doing it for you by an experienced WordPress professional every month.
