Have your site performing at maximum capacity on a server specifically optimized for WordPress hosting.

One of the reasons WordPress is so popular is that it’s easily hosted. If you have PHP, MySQL and a web server, you’re up and running.

The problem is once your site starts to get some real traffic it can start to come to a crawl. With the traffic comes exposure, to regular visitors and hackers. Now at a critical time in your site’s evolution where you need it performing at its best, it’s at its worst.

This is where the difference between cheap shared web hosting and a dedicated WordPress hosting solution come in.

Our hosting architecture is built on top of Google’s own cloud with best in class speed and security and networking (traffic is served on their premium tier network). We use only the latest versions of PHP and MySQL for huge speed and security improvements. By default we implement server side caching for near instant page loads. The web server is also fine-tuned to deliver files and pages as fast as possible.

We even pro-actively monitor the backend of your site, such as your database, for potential bottlenecks that may arise.

We’ll even check with you to see where most of your traffic comes from and set up your server as close to that location as possible squeeze even more speed out of every page load.
